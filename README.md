Welcome to Foolish Records - a React single page application. Produced and mixed by @ChefJoseph and @uperezac, this app takes advantage of React’s components-led organization scheme. The page has full searching functionalities - one can search for the records by the title, artist, genre, release year, and price. The user is also able to see vinyl Twitter news  through the Twitter button in the header. The app also takes advantage of React’s “POST” command to allow users to subscribe to the email list database.

This project was for Phase-2 of the Flatiron SWE course, which required the creation of a SPA using Meta’s very own React JS.
